fedup - the Fedora Upgrader
===========================

`fedup` is the Fedora Upgrade tool. It has two main parts:

Pre-upgrade::
    Not literally `preupgrade`, but similar in principle. The `fedup-cli` or
    `fedup-gtk` scripts prepare a system for upgrade by getting all the
    needed packages, modifying the bootloader, etc.

Upgrade::
    After the system reboots, the `fedora-upgrade` service actually installs
    all the packages to upgrade the system.
